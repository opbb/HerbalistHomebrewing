  questDialogue: Psst. I heard you make potions and concoctions of sorts from my
    parents. Could you make me an Essence of Dreams? Life here in the village is
    so boring.
  questCompleteDialogue: This is exactly what I needed! Thank you!
  questAcceptDialogue: Yes! I'm so ready to have some excitement in my life ... for
    once.
  questRejectDialogue: '*Sigh* I knew nothing fun could come out of this village.'
  questInProgressDialogue: Get that to me when you can, but keep in mind I'm practically
    dying from boredom.
