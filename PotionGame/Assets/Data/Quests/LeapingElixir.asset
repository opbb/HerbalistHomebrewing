  questDialogue: I'm so tired of needing a step-stool for the top shelf. I've come
    to terms with my short-ness but could you brew me a Leaping Elixir?
  questCompleteDialogue: This will save me so much time! Thank you.
  questAcceptDialogue: I can't wait to get rid of all of those step stools cluttering
    my floor.
  questRejectDialogue: Now I'll be stuck on my tippy-toes for the rest of my life.
  questInProgressDialogue: Can I get my potion soon? My tiny legs can only do so
    much.
