  questDialogue: I know people here bother you a lot for your abilities. I'm going
    to need a series of potions for this project I'm working on but could you instead
    brew me a Potion of Enchantment that'll give me special powers?
  questCompleteDialogue: I hope the effects last forever!
  questAcceptDialogue: I want to be able to do all sorts of things with one potion!
  questRejectDialogue: I guess I'll have to do things the old fashioned way.
  questInProgressDialogue: How's that super special potion going?
